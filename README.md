Script to generate this Anki deck: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/372683967

Also contains the subdecks as Anki dosen't seem to preserve the order.


Anki subdeck is based on level by level division based on "Secrets of Mental Math" by Arthur T. Benjamin and Michael Shermer. However, you can use these decks even if you do not have this book as it doesn't really depend on that. The best thing is that you can start as a beginner from the addition and subtraction and gradually go up to the 2 digit squares, 2/3 digits multiply and divide, percentage, Compound Interest then mnemonics and the final one. These mnemonics are based on the book which you can also find on http://numzi.com/numzi/ Problems were generated using python scripts manually The card contains the following subdecks:

Add/Subtract - 3 Digit
